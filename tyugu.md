# Concept Programming

CP here is a programming model described in the works of Enn Heraldovich Tyugu about model-based software development. It is not mean the term by Alexsandr Stepanov here. The common idea is about making domain models describe the problem in a wide in the form of relation networks, and automatic program (code) synthesis from specifications to solve concrete tasks. This synthesis works over these networks using them as generic knowledge representation.
